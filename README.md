### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Jess**. I'm a CGI pipeline developer by trade, but I also enjoy making little games and strange tools!

My professional experience is largely in Python but I work on my own time on learning and developing in languages like C# and Javascript, and in environments such as Unity, UE4+ and Godot. I have a passion for good docs and dev team organization, and my favorite problems involve systems and understanding ecosystems. I really enjoy experimenting with indie tools, like Ink and Bitsy. My educational background is in game art, where I learned that I like building systems and mechanics a little bit more.

I also enjoy narrative design, writing, digital art and comics, and reading all kinds of exploratory nonfiction. ðŸŒ±
